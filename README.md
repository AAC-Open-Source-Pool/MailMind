Abstract
<p align="left"> Mailify – Mail to Agenda is a smart email classification system that filters incoming non-spam mails into two distinct categories: Event-based and Non-event-based. Event-related emails are automatically integrated into Google Calendar, ensuring users never miss an important meeting or occasion. Non-event-based emails are sorted by priority, allowing for a cleaner and more productive inbox. The project leverages NLP, machine learning, and Google APIs to deliver a seamless automation experience. </p>
